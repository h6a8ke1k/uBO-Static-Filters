# uBO Static Filters

This is a static filter created by me as a supplement to existing filters for Baidu, 163, Bilibili, and Bing.

## What is filtered?

1. Baidu search: right-side column showing relevant searching / ads, and relevant searching displayed after clicking on the links / scrolling upwards.
2. 163 mail: the home page full of annoying contents on the home page after login, ad tabs that are not able to be hidden by default in settings, pop-ups in the bottom-right corner.
3. Bilibili: animated floating objects.
4. Bing: chatbot.
5. Tencent Video: video ads.
